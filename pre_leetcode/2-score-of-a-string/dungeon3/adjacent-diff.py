# # Dungeon 3 — Adjacent Character Difference 🗡️

# **Goal:** Begin computing differences between ASCII values of neighboring characters.

# ## Tasks:
# 1. Ask the user to enter a string (at least 2 characters long).
# 2. Loop through the string **by index** from the first character to the second-to-last character.
# 3. For each character, compare it to the **next** character in the string.
# 4. Use `ord()` to get ASCII values.
# 5. Compute the **absolute difference** using `abs()`.
# 6. Print the pair of characters and their difference.

# ### Example (not code, just concept):
# Input: `hi`
# - 'h' = 104
# - 'i' = 105  
# Difference: |104 - 105| = 1

# **Purpose:** This prepares you for the final calculation used in **Score of a String (LeetCode)**.
