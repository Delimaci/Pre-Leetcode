# # Dungeon 8 — Vowel Counter Quest 🔮
#
# **Goal:** Count how many vowels are in a string.
#
# ## Tasks:
# 1. Ask the user to enter a string.
# 2. Create a variable `vowel_count` and set it to 0.
# 3. Loop through each character in the string.
# 4. For each character:
#    - Check if it is a vowel: a, e, i, o, u (lowercase).
#    - If it is, increase `vowel_count` by 1.
# 5. After the loop, print the number of vowels.
#
# ### Example (concept only):
# Input: "apple"
# Vowels: a, e → total = 2
#
# **Purpose:** Practice checking conditions inside loops.
