# Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

# A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards.

# Examples:
# Input: x = 121
# Output: true

# Input: x = -121
# Output: false

# Input: x = 10
# Output: false

# Constraints:
# -2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1

# Since this is a small question, there is only one dungeon.
