# 🏰 Dungeon 9 — Multiples Collector
# Goal: Collect multiples of 3 and 5 into a list.
# Task:
# Ask the user for a number n.
# Loop from 1 to n using for i in range(1, n+1).
# For each number:
# If it’s divisible by 3, append "Fizz" to a list.
# If it’s divisible by 5, append "Buzz" to the list.
# Otherwise, append the number itself as a string.
# At the end, print the list.
# Hints:
# Create an empty list before the loop: results = []
# Append items with: results.append(...)
# Use modulo % to check divisibility
# Don’t worry about numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 yet — that comes in Dungeon 10!
