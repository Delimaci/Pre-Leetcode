# 🔥 Dungeon 6 — “Buzz Time” 🐝 🔥
# We’re leveling up! Now we handle multiples of 5, but not 3 yet.
# Your Task:
# Ask the user for a number n.
# Loop from 1 to n using range(1, n+1).
# For each number:
# If divisible by 5 → print "Buzz"
# Else → print the number itself
# Hints:
# Use % to check divisibility by 5.
# Use if/else.
# Don’t worry about 3 yet — that’s for the next dungeon.
